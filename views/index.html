#### Who are you?!
We are **Veteran Unix Admins** and we are concerned about what is happening to Debian GNU/Linux to the point of considering a fork of the project.

#### And why would you do that?

Some of us are upstream developers, some professional sysadmins: we are all concerned peers interacting with Debian and derivatives on a daily basis.

We don't want to be forced to use systemd in substitution to the traditional UNIX sysvinit init, because systemd betrays the UNIX philosophy.

We contemplate adopting more recent alternatives to sysvinit, but not those undermining the basic design principles of "do one thing and do it well" with a complex collection of dozens of tightly coupled binaries and opaque logs.

#### Are there better solutions than forking?

Yes: vote [Ian Jackson's proposal to preserve freedom of choice of init systems](https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2014/10/msg00001.html).

Then make sure sysvinit stays the default for now, systemd can be optional.

Debian leaders can go on evaluating more init systems, just not impose one that ignores the needs of most of its users.


#### Is really all this fuss necessary?

To quote Ian Jackson:

 "*This resolution is not only important within Debian, and not only for jessie (its next release). It is also important feedback for upstreams, and our peer distros and downstreams*".

#### Why is this happening in your opinion?

The current leadership of the project is heavily influenced by GNOME developers and too much inclined to consider desktop needs as crucial to the project, despite the fact that the majority of Debian users are tech-savvy system administrators.

Moreover Debian today is haunted by the tendency to betray its own mandate, a base principle of the Free Software movement: put the user's rights first. What is happening now instead is that through a so called "do-ocracy" developers and package maintainers are imposing their choices on users.

#### Can you articulate your critique to systemd?

To paraphrase Eric S. Raymond on the issue, we see systemd being very prone to mission creep and bloat and likely to turn into a nasty hairball over the longer term.

We like controlling the startup of the system with shell scripts that are readable, because readability grants a certain level of power and consciousness for those among us who are literate, and we believe that centralizing control services, sockets, devices, mounts, etc., all within one daemon is a slap in the face of the UNIX philosophy.

A timely reply by some people willing to use systemd is visible at [forkfedora.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20141020161905/http://forkfedora.org/). This page is useful to highlight a fundamental difference: systemd may simplify the task of configuring init, but it does so by enforcing an increasingly opaque approach to the init procedure. In systemd sure it appears easier: one can tweak a few variables and have all the rest handled by a big binary system that is way bigger than sysvinit.

```
  ls -lH /sbin/init
  sysvinit: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 36992 Jul 14  2013 /sbin/init
  systemd: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1317632 Sep  1 14:41 /sbin/init
# You may not be veteran enough, but you're already pretty fat.
```

It can be said that the security model of systemd relies much more on developers and package maintainers and much less on system administrators.  As Debian users we are simply asking not to be forced into this model and, taking into account [the CTTE vote on the issue was almost draw](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7203364), we believe its execution should be way more attentive in listening to what many users are asking: freedom of choice, starting from what we have.

#### How long are your beards?

This is not a beard contest, rest assured the furry ones among us are not sheep.

#### To sum it up?

If systemd will be substituting sysvinit in Debian, we will fork the project and create a new distro. We hope this won't be necessary, but we are well prepared for it.

If you like to follow how things evolve in Debian, here is the page about the [General Resolution: init system coupling](https://www.debian.org/vote/2014/vote_003).

#### We need to talk.

Sure, write an email to VUA@debianfork.org.

Following our call some people gathered on **IRC Freenode channel #debianfork**. Be welcome.

The [mailinglist is open to subscriptions](https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/dng). Break the ice if you feel like, take care to do it for a reason.

#### Are you guys alone in this?

Not at all, there are more protests against the imposition of systemd on users.

This article is a good introduction to the issue at hand: [Systemd: Harbinger of the Linux apocalypse](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2608798/data-center/systemd--harbinger-of-the-linux-apocalypse.html).

There is the [boycott systemd](http://boycottsystemd.org/) website providing several references.

Then there is the "systemd fork" called [uselessd](http://uselessd.darknedgy.net/) with some good points and lots of lulz.

An exit strategy is being elaborated at [The World After Systemd](http://the-world-after-systemd.ungleich.ch/)

The wikipedia page lists also some critiques in its [systemd reception](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd#Reception) section.

With our protest we intend to represent the discontent of Debian users, because that's who we are. We intend to keep using Debian on our servers, or a fork if necessary. Others might have other goals, but we all share a common problem: systemd being imposed on us.

#### Thanks for doing this. How can I help?

Join the development via our mailinglist, github or IRC channel.

To all those willing to donate: Thanks! this is needed.

The first fundraising round is going to start soon, to support the new infrastructure setup and the production of proof of concepts, analysis and long term plans.

If you write us we will keep you posted for the important updates, as we did until now.

#### How are people reacting to your protest?

Here below some of the messages we are receiving. If you write us please consider we may quote you anonymously, unless you specify not to.

We will keep your email private and later send you a notice about our next steps.

```

   I'm with you guys in the way that systemd is not the way forward. But I do
   not think that sysvinit is the way forward either. Maybe another init
   system? Like GNU DMD? I know its still pretty immature, but I think it's a
   good init system. I don't think sysvinit is ever going to make a comeback.

   And forking Debian? That's a very hard feat. Debian is the biggest Linux
   distro to date with hundreds of developers and at least 10 times as much
   users. And you'll have to change a lot of things from upstream. Even
   Ubuntu decided to use systemd instead of having to change the base init to
   upstart. Perhaps going to Slackware instead? That's what I use. Its very
   UNIX like. If that's what you strive for.

```

```

Thank you so much for this. I've been using Debian since Hamm and this
systemd nonsense has me ready to jump ship.

```

```

   I don't know who is behind that email, but sincerely, thank you for
   doing this.  I'm an UNIX/Linux sysadmin for nearly 20 years, I am
   nowadays dealing with a 5k servers which consists of nearny 90%
   debian systems. I've been a long time opponent to systemd, first
   because I read the code (thing that too few of that crap's zealots
   do), and ultimately because I tried it. That thing is a desktop
   toy, and even then, it has failed me on 50% of the cases. Its very
   nature is an abomination to UNIX principles and me and my team,
   colleagues, friends on the sysadmin field are *VERY* worried (to
   say the least) on what's coming.  Please keep that movement going,
   make it strong, and if you want a hand, count me in.

  Again, thank you.

```

```

I've been using runit as my init system on debian wheezy/jessie for a
while now and it works pretty well. glad to see the effort though on
debianfork.org . cool.

```

```

   Do you realize that there's already more than 150 Debian
   derivative?  Instead of doing one more, you're better off helping
   one of the already existing derivatives. Writing "fork" is the joke
   part, since that would only be a derivative, unless every Debian
   Developer follows you, which will *not* happen.

   Also, instead of just writing words on the internet, wouldn't you
   think that helping some of the systemd alternative be a lot more
   productive?

   FYI, I don't like systemd either. And I've been maintaining OpenRC
   in Debian, and trying to push for it to work on as many arch as
   possible.  Though I currently don't have the time for it (for
   professional and personal reasons), and some others are a bit
   taking over the work, but it's not going as fast as it should. Some
   help would be awesome, and would help a way better than writing
   funny text on the net.

```

```

I will support you guys with code if the fork goes ahead. But kindly
think of another name.

```

```

   Why don't you guys help out with Debian LTS? No systemd there, and
   they need help at the moment.

```


```

I'm in, at least in general.  "because readability grants a certain
level of power and consciousness for those among us who are literate"

I'd edit that to add that systemd is for software devs, but sysvinit
is for sysadmins.  Sysadmins can debug shell scripts, but not
necessarily debug and recompile systemd, which will of course be
necessary in the course of admin duties.  Excessive product tying and
complication for the sake of complication takes away the ability of
admins to administer, which is highly counter productive.  The
response from the systemd astroturfers is invariably along the lines
of software, especially our software, will never have bugs (LOL)

"Pure Debian by Veteran Unix Admins." any other name has to be better
than that.  At least try not to violate trademarks by putting in (tm).

You missed an excellent lack of freedom argument.  There will be only
one way to do it and it will be mandatory and all else will be
forbidden and only one guy gets to decide.  Intentional
incompatibility is a pretty screwed up way to go thru life.  It does
not help that most of the new features and abilities of systemd appear
totally useless.  If one mp3 player was useless and awful, that would
be OK, unless the inquisition extinguished all other mp3
players... that would suck.  Although this is whats being done with
systemd.

And the embrace extend extinguish issue.  If submarine software
patents sink apache (unlikely, but possible) then I don't really care
although the emergency conversion to nginx might be a PITA for a day.
When the one and only init system to bind them all is subverted either
by submarine patent or security holes then the temporary work around
will be to install the xyz package to switch to ... well I guess it'll
be impossible and I'd have to switch to freebsd.

There is a cost - benefit ratio issue.  Most of what systemd is
capable of doing is unfortunately completely useless and irrelevant in
comparison to what is being lost WRT to ease of debugging and
reliability and security and freedom.  If the costs were low/zero, the
useless features it provides would likely still not be worth it, but
at least the ratio would make it less awful.  To some extent the whole
situation is a farce.  You've got software devs deciding what desktop
users that don't exist want, while ignoring actual current desktop
users, and they're re-applying that "successful" (LOL) development
model to screw over sysadmins, and we're not subject to being told
what we want by non-admins.  Its a very arrogant business model.

```


```

   If/when you start publishing work for your fork

   Can you see if it can be documented in a way those of us in the redhat
   world could take advantage of it? We have the same problem and concerns,
   well at least the could *nix admin in our shop. Myself included.

   We are also considering looking at alternatives and we all have used
   debian in the past and most use ubuntu for desktop (there is always that
   one mandrake guy) so I will be keeping an eye on this project as well.

```


```

Whatever the outcome you have my support !

Using various Unices since System V on an ICL Clan 4, and as long-time
BSD, Slackware and Debian user, I just don’t want systemd imposed on
me, whatever the purpose. Whether it’s total crap, a good idea or a
mix of both, this has to be *optional* and surely not a default. I
want to keep my servers and embedded systems bloat-free with only
their intended software sets installed.  Why don’t *they* fork Debian
and do whatever they want ? I like Debian the way it is (was) like a
good grilled steak with nothing superfluous added, no fancy
sauce. Thank you for your efforts !

```


```

   I've been on Linux for over 15 years, I'm also a contributor in
   Fedora and author of NetworkManager-ssh (SSH plugin for Network
   manager). I'm a sort of a cross between a sysadmin and developer,
   currently doing both.

   I'm predominantly a Fedora user (and contributor) and am thinking
   recently about forsaking Fedora in favour of something without
   systemd (was thinking PCBSD). I've been around Linux for a while
   and understand the core philosophy behind it and how systemd just
   betrays all of that. I actually had an argument with Mr. Pottering
   on the Fedora-dev list about having /var/log/messages having a
   binary format. When log files in linux will not be plain text -
   it'll be the end in my opinion. needless to say Pottering didn't
   agree with me and tried to shut me up.

   Pottering somehow managed to push systemd quite far in Fedora and
   at the moment I'm in absorption mode trying to digest WTF happened
   to my Fedora with systemd. Horrow show.

   If this fork goes forward, I promise to try and do my best to
   contriube as much as possible. I'm good with packaging and shell, I
   believe I will be able to help. I think you guys hit the nail on
   the head with your web page and you have my full support.

   Lets not let our voice be silenced

```

```

As a veteran (20+ years; Solaris, HP-UX, RHEL, Debian) sysadmin who
prefers Debian over everything for use on about 40 GUIless servers,
it's either this (a fork away from systemd) or I move away from Debian
altogether.

```

```

   Many thanks for the effort here, while it's not a big thing to
   replace systemd on jessie/sid installation with sysvinit, it's not
   easy to create an installer image which installs the OS without
   systemd. I made an image which you can find on
   http://without-systemd.org/debian-jessie/ The big problem is
   tasksel, tasksell will install all Packages with the priorities
   required, important and standard. Unfortunately systemd has the
   priority importand and will be installed again, if you select
   "standard system utilities" in tasksel, to fix that, i would have
   to create my own Debian repository :-(

   I hope for a solution without a fork. But if you need help with
   forking, please contact me.

```

```

I support your idea of forking Debian to exclude systemd and its
multitude of tentacles. Please follow through. Also, please make
available means by which us mere users (though I've got kernel-hacking
and systems-architecture ambitions myself) may participate in an
effective way.

As I see it, the simplest way to fork Debian as of october 2014 would
entail taking a full-system snapshot (per package versions), available
from snapshot.d.o, from a time before systemd dependencies were
introduced, and then adding on top any updates that didn't add
such. This would re-use nearly all mainline Debian effort and require
only porting of e.g. eudev from other systemd-less distributions. Of
course GNOME would have to go; fortunately there is MATE.

```

```

   Thanks for doing this. I run four Debian servers in production,
   three of which are connected to an IRC network. Gnome remains the
   default DE on Debian for accessibility reasons, so it's obvious
   they have the monopoly of votes in favor of systemd. Large
   companies like Red Hat are also backing destroying the
   UNIX-philosophies.

   Once I heard Debian would be making the switch to systemd, I've
   been slowly migrating all Debian servers over to OpenBSD over the
   impending death of Debian. There's still much that leaves me
   missing Debian, most importantly the large amount of different
   packages that are not available in OpenBSD and would take lots of
   effort to port over.

```

```

I have been worried about systemd colonizing all the linux distros for
a long time and it's really happening. I want users to retain freedom
to use the init system they choose rather than being locked in.

The debian mailing list vote about whether to switch to systemd was
atrocious, in no way did it come to a consensus but they still forced
this upon us? This was the reason I quit using debian. If you look
around there are very few remaining distros that aren't getting taken
over by systemd!

Your project is a good idea and I wish you the best.

```

```

   Should set up a page collecting signatures

   I'd add mine in a heartbeat.

   It would make an interesting list of people.

```

```

Does it have to come to this?  I get the feeling that there is a
tsunami of opposition to systemd, and most of it seems to be from very
knowledgeable guys.  What I hear about systemd is very worrying, how
is it that Debian could get to the brink of a fundamental fork over
something that so many people think is Absolutely Wrong?  Who is in
charge here, and what are they thinking?

```

```

   I like the idea of Debian not being tied to systemd - whether that
   comes around through voting or forking seems immaterial.

   That said it's too late for me; the very fact that systemd is a
   likely prospect has motivated me to jump ship to FreeBSD.  I'm
   already using it on my personal laptop, and will be migrating all
   my machines over to it shortly.

   So, something to consider: some long-time (since 1995, in my case!)
   Linux users have already voted with their feet.  The Debian team
   shouldn't necessarily take silence as consent, as the most deeply
   disaffected users may already have left.

   In fact, a long-term FreeBSD user I know says there's been a spike
   of interest on the BSD lists since systemd was announced.  I
   suspect I'm far from alone in having already departed.

```

```

I’d really appreciate if you work tightly on something that
could possibly remove bad consequences of systemd’s “brute spellforce”
integration in major distros by GNOME’s and RedHat’s employees. My
only warning to you will be that I can predict much of major distros
supporters are not very educated about UNIX philosophy and related
things and that way RH and GNOME will easily convince them by great
masses splitting UNIX and GNU/Linux popularity below the edge of elite
again. You need very strong voluntary public relations supporting
anti-systemd tendencies and not only coders of strong mind.

```



```

   Thanks guys for speaking up and saving the freedom to admin one of
   the few fully open distros.

   SysV Init ist he only reasonable thing at the moment from a
   security point of view,

   Systemd is a code maintainance nightmare waiting to come...

   If they want to use it for a desktop-only distribution, then they
   should make a flavour of it, along with all the non-X-Windows
   Destop stuff (Wayland, Mir).

   This is how it should be done - it's a pity the rocklinux
   distribution and its fork t2-project are both on hold lacking devs.


```

```

Your website is wonderful, and exactly the message that needs to be
going out in these trying times. I've been using Debian on my servers
and intermittently on my personal machines for about 6 years now,
through thick and thin, and the troubling wind of systemd is the only
thing that has made me even consider switching away. The binary
journals are absolutely evil, to say nothing of the awful desecration
of the Unix philosophy.

Keep fighting the good fight!

```

```

   Greetings, and thanks for your website and thoughts.

   Systemd is one thing, but what about dbus?  Some people like to
   have notifications pop up, for example when a Handbrake transcoding
   process is done.

   A systemd-free dbus could support a lot of existing packages
   without pulling in systemd.  According the apt-cache showpkg, 84
   packages depend on dbus There are 1520 commits in dbus since
   systemd support went in in 2010.

   Another approach would be to fork at the *package level familiar
   apps and libraries, turning off systemd or dbus compile options, to
   create e.g. audacity-lean instead of audacity.

   Of course, a complete fork would involve enormous manpower, people
   power

```


```

When I tried to voice my concerns on "Arch" Forums a couple years ago,
regarding my shock to what I called "the redhatization of Arch" -they
really didn't give a shit, to put it mildly.  :) I realize Arch Forums
are rough on their Users, but I never realized just how "Peotter-ized"
they had become.

People talk about jumping the Debian ship if Debian goes full-bore
systemd, the problem is there is almost nowhere to go now. ?  Redhat,
Arch, ... they and ALL their derivative distro's are now systemd, and
systemd only -with NO optional init's whatsoever. -no choice. -or
atleast, not easy ones, and definitely not without a lotta work, and
once dhcpd falls prey to systemd, well, it'll be all over -except for
the crying.  If Debian goes, and it will, then there will be NO ONE
left.

So yes, I fully support you guys if you have to fork a systemd-free
Debian, then so be it. I'm on your side.

I blame IBM/Redhat for this entire systemd-controlling nightmare.
IBM/Redhat/Intel/Gnome/Wayland ..., with Intel pushing for Wayland,
..., and guess what everything will be built around ? and I ain't just
talkin 'bout pulseaudio here -lol.  Systemd is an octopus with mammoth
contolling entanglements, getting more powerful with each day.

I surely hope this "fork" of Debian can become a future-proof survival
effort against the likes of this (juggernaut)-systemd-Linux ?  I am
not an advanced Programmer, I'm just an ex-Sysadmin.  I was there when
Solaris 10 moved to "SMF" as their "rc" scripts replacements,...
[1]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Management_Facility However,
the way Solaris did it was the "right" way for them, whereas to me,
Systemd, as it is in Linux, is so wrong, and much much worse.  SystmeD
is a basic rip-off of that.

SystemD represents the evil "Windopwsization" of Linux.  I mean, for
god sakes, what was so wrong about using "OpenRC" ?!, atleast that
damn thing is "portable".  And finally, that's the other reason I
support your efforts here.  I use OpenBSD, and FreeBSD regularly as
well, and I believe the ease of "portability" is also very important
across Linux <-> BSD's, wherever possible.

```

```

   Thank you for your intention to fork Debian when systemd becomes
   mandatory and the current poll is lost.

   I'm using Debian as a server system for about 15 years now and I'm
   very much used to administering sysvinit-scripts and I like them
   and I like the robustness of this system.

   You have my support for your idea!

```

```

I am a programmer and part-time system administrator. I, too, have
been considering whether or not a fork (given enough support) would be
possible if Debian choose systemd exclusively.  It is reassuring to
see that others are thinking along the same lines. If the fork does
need to go ahead, I would be very willing to assist.

```

```

   I am sysadmin and I am using Debian for servers since version
   2.0/Hamm. I don't like the direction of the Debian and most of my
   servers at the moment are still on Squeeze and I am not planning to
   upgrade them ever because of systemd crap.

   I am using 'runit' at the moment for keeping services up and
   running (was using daemontools before) and I want to see this
   system as an option for replacing init/systemd.

   My opinion -> FORK IT!

   I am familiar with debian package system and I will volunteer for
   package maintainer of the new fork of Debian if necesery.

```

```

Thanks for more publicity about keeping alternatives to systemd in
Debian.

There's another small group of people who collects data about running
Linux with proper init systems:

  http://the-world-after-systemd.ungleich.ch/

You may be also interested in the prevent-systemd-* packages in the
APT repository at http://users.unixforge.de/~tglaser/debs/debidx.htm

```

```

   I am one of those GNU/Linux users who chose to use it to avoid
   software imposition from above. With systemd I am experiencing the
   same blow, and it reminds me of the time, when changes in the OS
   took place following a direction I disliked as it didn't cater for
   the needs of someone like me. systemd will remove my freedom to
   modify the system the way I want it to be. It is a blow to software
   transparency and it will demotivate anyone choosing GNU/Linux to
   use a different OS with a different philosophy.

   Although, I am not formally qualified as a coder, I do it as a
   passtime. I learnt on my own and can use C++, C and Object Pascal.
   Lately, I have settled myself to using C++ although using C is a
   not inaccessible to me with some extra effort.

```

```

First i would like to say that i am not against your idea.
If you want to fork, just do it.Make your own distro.

Second, you should consider to actively participate in things that
matter and not just go for publicity like a good politician.Systemd
was voted, not enforced and that procedure has a name.Democracy.

Third you are not believable when you say you want alternative init
systems. Because you don't care what is best but what touches your
personal feelings.

By the way do you have any idea what resources it needs for such a
thing?  But of course you do not have the time to participate, so how
would you know?Ask Ubuntu.

Last let me say that in 2014 we need to think how to progress the
Linux ecosystem (not UNIX system} and there is no philosophy behind
it, it's not the meaning of life.There are morale issues on how
technology is used and that is why we care how it is build, that is
why we support open source.Engineering is just a skill and if you
disagree with what someone builds just do what you think is better.

```

```

   Thank you for this initiative, though i've only cross-read the
   counter-arguments they do appear valid and sufficiently
   substantiated by personal experience when it comes to such
   convoluted "one-in-all solutions" It is hard to believe an
   established company such as Red Hat is actually advocating it's
   use. Recently i've also learned about musl-libc which does seem to
   be a viable alternative for future system growth. At least in
   spirit and to some extent in proof already, not a perfect drop-in
   but the potential does seem obvious.

   Debian is a META-OS, i was there on fidonet when it took shape and
   the idea has proven visionary in many ways. Choosing for a
   mono-init-system approach would make it just another distro. Though
   by now it could probably need some trimming or reorganisation in
   some places, overall quality seems to have degraded a bit here and
   there.

   It is due time for a wiki dedicated to the design of a new init
   system, a massive community influenced design of such importance
   would prove significant in many ways. For non-critical systems
   systemd will have it's benefits but the "feel" is "awkward" even
   from an operational perspective.  Let's just not fall into another
   flamewar based on fear and prejudices on both sides, maybe the
   authors of systemd are forthcomming in adapting to the community
   criticism and a win-win can be achieved.

```

```

A wonderful idea. It would send a message that few could ignore that
systemd is a serious power grab and an unwelcome one at that.  I'm not
a coder, or a sysadmin, just a happy Linux user of some 12 years. It
was the philosophy behind Linux that attracted me and I see that
philosophy now almost entirely sidelined and ridiculed, partially by
the "our convenience is more import than your stupid philosophy"
distros and also by the systemd bullies.  So yes, as a user and long
time fan - please fork Debian and give us back the Linux we love so
much.

```


```

   Just to say I fully support your movement. There's only so much
   shit an innit system can do until it becomes svchost.exe.

```

```

Hi folks,

I want to thank you in the first place, for what you are doing!!
I am in the same situation like you are, and almost all the
professionals out there!!

I am a sysadmin for some time now(before I was a programmer only), and
I thought I was alone on this problem...
I run a small park of servers(more or less 400 servers), for high
availability...
I prefere debian off course, but now I am in a difficult
situation...because systemd will be banned in my systems, I DOENS`T
ALLOW SYSTEMD HERE!!!!

Systemd doesn't allow us to control our process's in the same way that
sysvinit does!!!
I want control, and a simple control, not some binaries that I don't
know exactly how they work underneath!

Systemd seem to be simple at the beginning, but when you want to adapt
some software, to automate him, or to change the way it work on the
system...ITS a NIGHTMARE!!!

Systemd is only good for desktop's ...NOT for mine, thanks!!

I doesn't care of speed in the boot process of my systems, because I
boot them ONE Time in at least 2-5 years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And my desktop/laptop's I boot them almost of the time, one time only
a day!!!

RUNLEVELS...what??

ABOMINATION what they have created , ABOMINATION!!!!!

RunLEVELS  are one of the tons of beautiful things of Unix like systems.

Runlevels should be preserved at ANY cost!!!
When I saw it I realized that the guys beguind systemd seem's to be
kids...that's the only answer...sorry for my conclusion, but I think
that not even 1 person with a minimal knowledge an respect for the
Unix like culture, exist's there!!

How a programmer has the guts to kill Runlevels, or at least remove
from the user the chance to use them explicitly!?

yes I Agree, when a attacker gains access to root, its a problem,
because the logs are exposed...and in this I agree that are some work
to do, but what they have done is so bad that I just can't accept it!!

Well, I write this email, that ends up being a rant, but the goal is
to supportyour actions towards this degrading situation, and if the
Debian committee doesn't care, encourage you guys to continue fighting
this problem that seems to stole the, freedom and power, we have on
our beloved Debian!

```

```

   If you want readable configuration, that is possible (even in
   systemd), since even relational databases can be implemented in
   plain text.  That said, perhaps a footnote about critical
   efficiencies might moot this minor point.

```

```

It's good to know that we're not alone and there are a lot more people
fighting against the cancerD infection on Debian/Linux. You have my
full support.

```

```

   I'm a "desktop user"; I administrate just a single personal server and so
   I don't really consider myself "a veteran unix admin".
   I wholeheartedly applaud your initiative in doing this.
   Thank you.

```

```

I agree with you about the importance of UNIX philosophy, I think the
GNU/Linux is taking a bad track and I fear this. Then what do you
think about replace GNU things like GCC, GDB and binutils (the
toolchain) for Clang, LLDB and LLVM? Besides, GNU is Not Unix, then we
cannot expect of them some attitude for bloated things like systemd.
Bash had a critical bug because it is bloated, luckily the Debian
default shell is dash. LLVM is more modular than GCC, so I think it
doesn't hurt UNIX philosophy and never will.
And what about GNOME? I like it and I use it, now I'm using Gnome 3.12
on my FreeBSD, could you build GNOME with no systemd?

         The recent discussions surrounding 'systemd' and 'sysvinit' have
   brought the "one thing done well" philosophy under renewed consideration.
   I would like us to consider the value of this philosophy in another
   situation -- Linux™ distributions.  Each week I see new distributions,
   each packaged to suit the preferences of yet another end-user community.
   Someone prefers a specific Desktop Environment. Someone else wants
   something different. Someone wants a specific initialization suite.
   Someone else wants something different.
   This diversity of preferences is a major strength of the Linux
   universe.[1]

         First, my humble definition of a Linux distribution.  "A
   distribution is a packaged collection of software components:  a kernel,
   drivers and modules, libraries, utilities, user interface, applications
   and so on."

   Why would anyone create a packaged collection of components?  One motive
   might be a belief that their collection has benefits not offered by
   existing collections.  Sadly, I don't hear much discussion about the "one
   thing done well" aspects of these collections.

        As a community, there is a tendency to treat a distribution as a
   monolith, but that is far from the case.  Consider "the kernel," "drivers"
   and "modules." [I call this the kernel suite.] As a collection, it is
   difficult to describe "one thing" that the suite needs to "do well."  I'll
   try:

     The kernel suite has the task of enabling the workstation hardware such
     that multiple utilities and applications can be installed, configured
     and run to deliver their designed benefits to end-users.

   Notice that I use very few words to describe the "one thing done well."
   Such a brief statement cannot be a specification or even a statement of
   requirements. However, these brief statements are crucial to any "one
   thing done well" evaluation.

         When I look at software suites and seek their description of "one
   thing done well" I usually find  large documents. What would you write as
   a description for a software suite such as 'systemd' 'upstart' or
   'sysvinit'? Let's consider the problem space in parts.

     * Once the kernel is loaded and running with a suitable set of drivers
       and modules, we are able to load and start a process-one executable to
       take over the activation of utilities, applications and such.  CHECK
       -- We can do this and do it well.
     * Process-one needs to read configuration details and activate those
       utilities, applications and such.  CHECK -- We can do this and do it
       well.
     * 'sysvinit' accomplishes the above in a handy way. This is especially
       true for workstations with a mostly static complement of utilities and
       applications.  For workstations with a dynamic complement, there are
       some difficulties.  Clearly beneficial for servers ... not so much for
       laptops.
     * 'systemd' does the job of handling the dynamic deployment of utilities
       and applications by responding to discovery events.  Many of these
       same events happen during a cold start and so systemd also handles the
       initial deployment.  Herein lies one possible source of confusion and
       conflict.Clearly beneficial for laptops ... not so much for servers.

   Given that "the static case" and "the dynamic case" are two things, this
   appears to violate the "one thing done well" philosophy.  When coupled
   with a large list of dependencies on supporting libraries and utilities,
   and we have a large and complex subsystem.

   The Linux universe has other large, complex subsystems -- web servers,
   email servers, database managers, etc.  These don't generate the sort of
   divisive language found in the 'systemd' discussion.  I seem to remember
   that they used to until enough time and effort allowed the benefits and
   liabilities to shake out and sound software engineering to refactor and
   otherwise address complexities of the early editions.

   ---
   [1] I use "universe" in the astronomical and cosmological sense rather
   than as an indicator of linux package availability made popular by certain
   distribution publishers.

```

```

People still focus on the wrong thing with this systemd debate. All
the arguments are just minor things too me. This is what is
particularly wrong with the whole thing:

There is a debate whether to replace legacy init-systems. It is a good
debate, and imho a new init system is very due.

What should have been done (*):

1.) define interfaces/apis for a new init system by the linux
    community/process
2.) standardaize these interface
3.) have somebody provide a reference implementation and
    reference-test-suite (an init-system is missing critical, I cannot debug
    umteenth servers when they fail initing)

   what has been done:

1.) a reference implementation has been pooped into existence with
    interfaces/apis 'designed' on the fly
2.) this mix of standards/implemention has then been pushed and force-fed
    to the community
3.) now the community is pissed

The discussion about whether or not systemd must be used is moot. If
standards exist, systemd can be replaced. If not, like we have now, it
cannot.

So, stop the stupid debate, and really get down to solving this
problem (see *).

   Hi.  I'm a professional Unix and Linux systems admin.  I work at
   Magellan Healthcare in the operations department.  My title is
   Senior System Administrator.  I've been doing this job at various
   places of employment for 19 years.  I've been involved with Unix
   since 1988.  I have a beard.   It is quite gray.  Please keep me in
   the loop on the Debian fork.  I will help preserve our way of life
   if I can.

```

```

i'm a simple Desktop user (Slackware) and mantainer of a stupid home
server with Debian.

I'm going to give you the simplest message:
i tried it, it's useless, it's not KISS.

With sysvinit i can manage everything, i can write whatever i want.
I was an Arch user *also* in the past, with systemd it's unusable.

Desktop environments can be changed, OSes not.
So please, KeepItDebianStupids.

```

```

   I've been following the whole SystemD mess closely and am extremely
   worried by how over the last two years one distribution after the
   other fell in line, with Debian and Gentoo being the only big ones
   left. If mainline Debian goes full-on SystemD as well I'm glad that
   there's already people who will maintain a clean fork.

```

```

Thank you for helping bring this to the forefront.
I am a Debian User (Rasbian, Debian, etc); however, where I use a GUI
I used KDE. I don't use GNOME or other functionality that is
necessarily dependent on systemd and very much do not like the path
that systemd is taking in being integrated into parts, or the fact
that a few users in the GNOME community are essentially forcing it
down everyone else's throats because it is easier to distributions to
do that than to fix those few projects.
I would very much like to rid my system of systemd. I like the "do one
thing and do it well" approach. That is one thing that attracted me to
Linux to start with; and one thing that has over the years led me to
Debian and the APT system.
Systemd has been a thorn in my side for numerous reasons. First, their
insistence that it is no longer advantageous to have a self contained
root (/) with a separately mountable /usr leading to distros changing
things up (even Gentoo) in ways that broke existing systems on
upgrades. Second, their entire "build it all into systemd" approach
instead of building separate utilities that work well together and can
be easily interfaced so that scripts, daemons, and tools can be
written to manage them all as necessary for the tasks.
I fully support breaking away from existing distros if that is what it
takes to get a wakeup call that systemd is not desired by many users.
Users who continue to want the tools that distros like Debian provide,
but do not want the dependency on systemd.

```

   THANK YOU

   I am Systems Manager for an installed base of over 2000 kiosks
   running an OS built on Ubuntu.  I've ran Debian and Ubuntu on my
   home and work desktops, laptops, and servers since I ditched OS/2
   in the late 90s.

   I have the Unix philosophy pasted on my wall.  Most notable here is:
   * Make each program do one thing well.
   * Store data in flat text files.
   * Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.

   The developer across from me runs Fedora and deals with his
   workstation breaking every day or three due to systemd bugs.
   He's had enough too.

   My advise -- open up the collection jar to finance the birth of
   DebianFork.

```

```

I've been a GNU/Linux user and developer since I was a kid, when the
kernel crashed now and again. I grew up with open source and the
community-oriented feeling that distinguishes us from the rest of the
cyberspace and I find absurd that "someone" is pushing systemd so
hard, that many distributions have chosen to forsake that spirit that
makes us what we are. We should not forget that we ARE the
alternative, but without freedom of choice, what alternative can we
be?

For long time I've been an Archlinux user and now that they (and many
others) enforced systemd, I'm working on my own GNU/Linux system to
have my freedom back. With your reaction you are showing the entire
community that the spirit of choice is not dead.

Hope your project succeeds, you have all my support.

   Hello.  I share your concerns on http://debianfork.org/ about
   systemd vs Debian.  However, i don't agree on forking as a
   solution, maintaining a distro is no simple task, just maintaining
   repositories is by itself and herculean feat.  Yo have to always
   consider the cost, which of course is much more than just money.

   I propose you the same solution published in Infoworld by Paul
   Venezia article: "It's time to split Linux distros in two"
   Link:
   http://www.infoworld.com/article/2608973/linux/it-s-time-to-split-linux-distros-in-two.html

   In short, talk to debian decision makers, propose than Debian shall
   have 2 editions by version 8.0: Desktop and Server. Keep sysVinit
   on Server, and the door open to use a non-systemd replacement in
   the future.  Thanks.  PS: i know that meddling in politics is a
   PIA, but sometimes, if you don't, politics meddle with you.

Hey guys!
DebianFork without systemd? I'm in!

I truly believe that there is room for a new distribution, that
(maybe) will sit right in the middle of Debian and Slackware...

I mean, Slackware doesn't have/need systemd, dbus, neither pam! So, I
think that it is time to build a DebianFork that is even more
minimalistic (than Debian 7)... For example, a Debian without
systemd/dbus/pam, what about that?!

Nevertheless, what we'll use in place of systemd? uselessd, lol ? Do
we need to fork dbus before it got engulfed/merged by system? Or, can
we use systemd at its minimum level, for example, just as udev/logind,
but not as an init replacement ?

BTW, I'm using Debian since Potato and it is very hard to believe that
this is happening... Maybe it is for a greater good!  :-) Ah!
I'm not using GNOME or KDE, I'm with Enlightenment 19, so, I don't
give a damn about it (GNOME dependency on systemd). Maybe this
DebianFork should focus on EFL!!  ;-D

```

```

   I've been using 'nix since Research Unix v6 in the late 70's.  My
   code's in Berkeley Unix, SunOS/Solaris et.al., and various Linux
   distributions.  I run OpenBSD, Mint Linux, FreeBSD, CentOS Linux,
   Solaris, and half a dozen other distributions at the moment.

   The rush to make systemd the end-all be-all is quite disturbing to
   me, not only because it flies in the face of the Unix and "Software
   Tools" philosophy -- a tool should do one thing and do it well --
   but because there's seems to be quite a rush to shove it into
   distributions without carefully considering its long-term impact --
   including the security implications.  A powerful tool is useful;
   but it's useful for *everyone*, including adversaries, and the more
   functions that are crammed into systemd, the more attractive a
   target it will become.

   I'm not saying that the functionality offered by systemd is a bad
   thing: it's not.  I'm saying that architecturally superior ways of
   providing that functionality [mostly] exist, and those that don't
   should be and can be implemented by far less complex, opaque and
   unwieldly tools.

   It would be a *serious* strategic error to force its use in Debian
   -- or in any other distribution for that matter.  I don't see a
   problem offering it as alternative, but it should NOT be the
   default and it should NOT be required.

   Those with contrary views are strongly encouraged to read "Software
   Tools" by Kernighan and Plauger, which is arguably -- still -- one
   of the very best books for anyone engaged in any form of software
   development, and should be mandatory reading for anyone doing so in
   the 'nix world.

```

```

Hi guys (and ladies ?) :)

I'll make it short, I'm mostly OK with what you expose, though I'd
rather like Debian to move the right way than to have to follow the
fork.

Anyway, I'm working with Debian systems, and the time lost due to
systemd is not an option for me. Keep me informed if you have a
mailing list. (The information I would love most would be "no need to
fork anymore" :)

```


```

I think what you are doing is quite important.

I originally did like systemd, because normal initscripts are really
hard to write well and portably  (for example, try running a second
instance of $daemon_of_choice and see whether "service daemon stop"
kills your personal copy as well as the main one). Also, the "service
$daemon status" messages under systemd are much more helpful.

I find systemd inelegant because it is so badly cross-coupled.
For example, why does it need to replace cron?  (there may be a
separate case to be made for a new version of cron, but not one that
belongs in the init system). The whole thing doesn't feel very Unixy.

Even desktop users have no real benefit from a few second reduction in
boot (I only reboot for kernel updates and power failures), and I
don't mind too much if postgres and apache aren't running for the
first 5 seconds after I log in!  Likewise, laptop users mostly need
good suspend, rather than good reboot.


```

```

   Since the announce of debian in favor of systemd, i started migrate my
   systems to FreeBSD. If you guys fork the debian project, you can count on
   me to help. I want a system the respects their users.

```

```

I applaud your determination to prevent systemd from taking over the
Linux world. At least I hope that's y our intention.  Not just to
protect Debian but (at least a lot of) Linux. I have to take exception
to an intimation presen t in your presentation at
http://debianfork.org/ "Shall We Fork Debian."

It seems that you feel that systemd is designed for the desktop
user. I don't know if that's true, but I d oubt it; I think it is
designed to take over the Linux world. However, I would hope that you
folks do not ignore the deskto p user. Me.

I am not even a user of Debian. I am a user of PCLinuxOS, which
fortunately has not (as of now) gone to sy stemd. However, if systemd
takes over the Linux world, and makes virtually every app depend on
it, then PCLOS will have li ttle chance to remain independent, short
of maintaining every app themselves.

I don't want to see Linux turned into another Windows, with its
registry. By some other name, perhaps, tha t is what the Poetering
conspiracy is aiming to do.  I am looking to be able to find and use
software from any distro, a s well as some software that may not be
open source, or even free. That sort of software will be unobtainium
if Linu x becomes a poor imitation of Windows. (Of maybe it will
become such an imitation that most software will only be av ailable
for a fee.)

I wonder if the idea that systemd is designed for desktop users only
because it boots faster? I don't beli eve the designers of systemd
thought that way. For anyone who has used Windows, Linux, with its
sysvinit, _already_ boots qu ite fast enough!  (I almost never turn
off the computer anyway.)

More power to you guys! Just don't leave the desktop user out of your
fork, please!

```

```

One alternative not mentioned so far is to move to Gentoo.
I've been using it on my desktop since 2003 & wouldn't use anything else ;
most users seem to be people who build their own machines (I do)
& many administer large numbers of servers, like your group.
I'm sure the Gentoo developers would like help with OpenRC.
Gentoo is about choice & you should find yourselves among friends.

I switched to Debian with the release of 0.93R5 and I kept loyal
regardless of its degradation through ubuntification. But a switch to
systemd is a no go. If a fork should prove necessary, I'm with you.

```


```

Doing this anonymously means you have very limited credibilty. Ian Murdock
didn't start the project by being nameless and faceless.

```

```

   First, the topic of systemd is not one for discussion IMHO because I
   noticed that systemd is now showing up in the crypto packages. For me
   that's a third-rail type of non-starter. I will not ever use a
   distribution that has such a massive code base to review as part of crypto
   acceptability. So talking about it is a complete waste of bits.

   Note that the above issue is _not_ philosophical support for "the unix
   way". It is a real-life matter of practicality. Small tools represent
   incremental additions that need to be reviewed. Massive code bases cannot
   be effectively reviewed, so people don't even bother. See Micros~1
   Window~1 for a good example.

   Secondly, since managing dependencies is key to an effective startup
   sequence, I suggest that people consider DJB's redo system as a model. It
   is very simple. And very effective.

   Why should anyone care what I have to say? They shouldn't. Instead they
   should care about what they think after they read what I have to say.
   I've been a developer for over 40 years. I delivered my first
   high-performance, high-tech software system over 30 years ago (pointing
   lasers out of airplanes for NASA). I've worked at all levels of scale and
   all levels of development from nanocode to horizontal and vertical
   microcode to dozens of assemblers to C/C++ to more than a dozen "high
   level" programming languages and several languages so high their level
   isn't named that I know of. I administer several hundred machines ranging
   from 16KB Z80s, up to multi-CPU, many-core, NUMA machines with steaming
   heaps of main memory. Hint: I buy memory by the /pound/.

   But I am not a debian maintainer or developer. Just an avid user. I don't
   expect that to change, but the future is a mystery to me, so anything is
   possible.

   I wish you success (luck is for losers),

The drive towards systemd makes me glad I spend more time with Solaris.

Hi. Just wanted to add my support to those behind this website and
those others gathering in opposition to systemd.

I am noone of significance (home user). I came to GNU/Linux about 15
years ago and have tried several flav ours, with Slackware perhaps
being most memorable. I now (past 4-5 years) run Debian on a small
home serve r and on the couple of clients on the same network. My
customisations and CLI-fu are moderate.

I remember at first feeling awkward with the manner/approach of
GNU/Linux, but over time I have come to ap preciate the work done by
those have gone before tremendously. I tend to work a fair bit with
text files a nd find the ubiquity of handling this format constantly
impressive. I also love the UNIX philosophy of sma ll tools that can
be combined to produce custom solutions. While I could probably
transition to the upcomi ng systemd-based version, I believe, among
other things, it impairs my ability to learn how GNU/Linux work s.

I have watched the unfolding systemd saga with interest and a growing
sense of dis-ease. It appears corpor ate ideals (in particular,
homogeneity) have usurped the diversity that sits at the heart of the
UNIX phil osophy. The cavalier attitude towards existing installations
(and the work of those that have gone before) is also repugnant. I
remain hopeful that the Free Software community will route around this
problem, but it appears something of a David vs. Goliath situation.

```


```

Please do fork it if necessary.  I'm a longtime Linux user (1997) and
feel screwed by the anti-user arrogance these Red Hat guys are
showing.

I'm using Mint Mate 17 right now because of the Gnome guys and the KDE
guys went crazy.

It's not a legal problem so I cannot sue them for you:)

```


```

   I read your article called "Shall we fork Debian?" with great interest and
   alarm. I am only an everyday user of Debian and derivatives and don't
   understand the issues that you raised very well. However, I would be sad
   to see Debian fragmented again as it was when Ubuntu started. I hope all
   parties involved will be able to find a solution.

```

```
   Hi folks.

   The Sys V Init must be the default init System.

   Maybe the Installer have an option like choosing the default language.

   Please choose you're init System:

       (*) SysVinit
       ( ) systemd

   Many greeting und good luck

```

```

I don't actually pray, but if I did, I would be praying for a group of
people willing and able to fork deb ian to prevent the total abortion
that is systemd from absolutely destroying the entire future of
Linux. s ystemd really is THAT bad. This current situation is the
stuff of nightmares.

```


```

Hi there and kudos for you effort!

I do not feel strongly about either sysvinit or systemd or any of the
alternatives.  However, I do feel *very* strongly about being able to
setup the systems I am an admin for in the way I wa nt it.
I *really* like that I am able to choose the shell, mta, editor, web
server, database, etc. that I prefer working with.
Why should the init system be different?
Sometimes the software I chose turned out to be a bad idea.  But in my
book, the only thing worse than choosing the wrong software for a
given task is to not have a ch oice at all.

```

```

   I just wanted to thank you guys for protecting the sys V init philosophy,
   Very nice to know I am not alone !!!!!!
   Friendly greetings

I am with you guys.

Systemd is a problem looking for a solution. We do (did?) not have any
any problem with Debian: we do not need a solution.

I've been using Linux since the early 90s and have never seen
something like this. I am currently reviewin g options and considering
moving all my boxes to BSD. With systemd Debian is not a UNIX-like
operating sys tem anymore. Bye Debian, I will keep a fond memory of
our years together.

If you guys go ahead and fork I will help code if time
permits. Otherwise I will contribute financially to the project.

Keep the flame alive!

```

```

Thank you for your efforts.
Linux has devolved too far..

This systemd thing may make me use the original... windows..

```


```

   I'm seriously concerned about the whole systemd mess, and would
   *vastly* prefer Debian to have more choice about init systems --
   instead of being locked-in to the horrible systemd nightmare.

   Thanks for bringing the vote back and raising awareness

```


```

Hi guys,

I agree with you. Systemd is good at system start and that's what I
understand it should do. But it shouldn't do anything more.

Despite I'm RH (servers) and Fedora (desktop) guy, I appreciate your
effort.

Thank you very much!

```

```

I just wrote an update to my systemd troubles article with a link to
your site and the general resolution. Thank you for taking this up!
→ http://draketo.de/light/english/top-5-systemd-troubles

(besides: that systemd is controversial shows clearly in my access
stats: The top 5 systemd troubles article has been the most accessed
article on my site for weeks, if not months)

```


```

I'm very elated reading about debianfork.org.  Seeing all those
developer-Lemmings running for the systemd cliff, I already started to
think it might just be me who feels the horror.

If debianfork.org takes off, I'll move all my Debian systems over to
it and try to help with bug reporting/fixing.  Hopefully
Systemd-Jessie can be "upgraded" to the port without requiring a
reinstall.

```

```

Thanks a lot for your engagement! I've been a UNIX sysadmin for the
last 25 years now for different companies and on different flavours.
That whole discussion about changing the init system is IMHO really
about (further) changing the UNIX system to somthing fundamentally (in
more than one single sense, indeed) different, what I don't see the
need for. So as already written, let them check options for people who
like or really need that, but (@debianers:) let the system remain as
we all know it -- don't build a Babel tower.

```

```

Take comfort, you're about five years late to that party and there's
nothing left to shed tears over. Every Linux software developer
understands that systemd does the things it does the right way, and
it's a clean, powerful design (in the tradition of unix philosophy),
but - the main point - it's generally accepted by now! So end-user
software will (indirect) depend more and more on its features.

```

```

I think the approach you are taking is great. While I may still even
consider a distro that defaults to systemd, I want the choice to be
mine. Maybe it could be managed as a package set like the choice of
desktop for many distros (*buntu, mint).

Right now, I am planning to build a cloud. The current generation of
stable releases are not bound to systemd, but choosing one that will
not be bound to a specific init in the future either, is key, in order
avoid the burden of a huge migration if that specific init go south.

Please keep me posted about how things move on.

i am DD and one of the supporters of Ian Jacksons proposal. I am
professional sysadmin and software developer for more than 20 years
and i am using Debian from the very early relases.  systemd is
unacceptable for me because it doesnt restrict itself for beeing a
init replacement but rather gobbles up myriads of basic unix system
functionality up to the point in offering a "hostname" DBUS
functionality.  Think about it - Using thousands of LOC to request the
hostname via DBUS instead of opening a file or using a glibc
hostname(2) call. I am not even asking what the init has to deal with
a hostname or a hosts icon (see systemd-hostnamed). I dont care about
gnome depending on certain functionality in systemd to be operable. We
(as Debian) have had issues in the past where we decided not to follow
upstreams decision (e.g. the glibc vs eglibc case). Debian is not only
using upstream but influencing upstream. Telling the GNOME ecosystem
we dont like the architecture of systemd would send a strong signal.

I am willing to support and work for a Debian fork.

```

```

I'm a total newbie on all things linux, i run few servers but until
now I didn't even know what init means, it really doesn't even concern
me atm, in future i hope to learn more. I use Debian cos I like it, I
don't use Ubuntu cos Windows does desktop for me in my home and debian
is reliable on servers.

After all said and done and what I understood of all this, is that. If
I need debian like system for my desktop I will install Ubuntu Not
Debian and if I will need OS for my server I will use Debian.  I don't
understand why we would need 2x Ubuntu?

Thx for your efforts, seems to me like you are doing the right thing
and Debian guys are thinking something else.

   Two years ago, when I installed Fedora 15 with systemd for the
   first time, I felt like you do, fearing that the next big thing for
   Linux would be a windows-like "registry" database!

   But after learning how to deal with systemd and appreciating its
   advantages when dealing with encrypted hard disks, selinux and
   other security issues in servers, I changed my mind.

   Actually, over the years, I had far more issues with the
   NetworkManager than with systemd.

   I think that for desktops it is better than sysVinit. For servers
   it should be possible to choose, many sysadmin will prefer to stick
   to the good old sysVinit, and that's fine. In my servers I use a
   mix, all distro services are started with systemd, while other
   specific servers are started via sysVinit.

```

```

I'm been solely using Debian for over 10 years.  Both on my home desktop
and on my web server.  From the very beginning, I wrote my own simple
init system.  All it does is run a script at boot up.  I just want my
computer to run a list of commands when it boots up and nothing else.  I
don't need any more features than that.

What I love about the sysvinit scripts that come with Debian packages is
that I can easily just call them from my script if I want any of them to
run at boot time.  And if something goes wrong, I can examine those
scripts to see the problem, or make changes to them.

I just came across your website today, and after learning about systemd
from the links on your site, it is clear that there is no way I am ever
going to use it.  The boycott systemd website was the most influential
and convinced me completely that systemd is incredibly awful.

Since I'm running Debian testing on my desktop, I decided to look at the
packages, and there it was, systemd was installed automatically somehow
when upgrading my packages!  I've installed Debian once, 10 years ago,
and was just upgrading the packages occasionally ever since then, so
package upgrades was the only way systemd was able to sneak into my
computer.  It feels like my computer was infected by a bad virus.  I
quickly removed the systemd package and all packages that depended on it
without issues.  However, I noticed libsystemd0 was still installed and
doing a reverse dependency check showed that there are lots of important
packages that indirectly depended on it because of dbus depending on it.
 That is clearly a bug, and I hope Debian can fix this issue.  Normally,
I wouldn't object to having some library installed, but from what I read
about systemd from the links on your site, it's so awful that I don't
even want its library installed on my computer.

I really hope Debian doesn't create more dependencies on systemd or its
library, because I will NEVER run systemd.  If, in the future, Debian
has so many dependencies on systemd that I can no longer run a Debian
system without running systemd, I will be forced to switch away from
Debian after more than 10 years.

```

```

   I'm 100% with you. Well .. I myself will probably not that
   important. I'm not a long-term hard-core unix system admin. I'm not
   even a trained IT specialist. I'm a photographer and a pilot, but
   currently I earn my living from software development (C++ mainly)
   Unfortunately on Windows only.  However we run a couple of linux
   hosts here, mainly Suse. At home I manage a couple of destop and
   server systems. I have switched 100% to linux since
   2000. Mainly debian and Ubuntu.



   So, I'm *not* the server guy that wants his system v init back. But
   I share your views 100%. If you decide to fork, I'll follow suit.

   As a side note: call it "RealDebian" "TrueDebian" or the like. Bot
   DebianFork. IMHO it's the others that fork from the debian
   heritage.

```

```

I'm all for a Debian fork, but... who are you guys beyond "*Veteran
Unix Admin?"

*How about some names, bios, an email list?

```

```

   I understand that there is a lot to systemd, and to dbus, but I see
   improvement on some parts of it. The /usr/lib/systemd/system
   contains services, targets, and wants. This is a very clean way of
   doing things, and adds a lot of power to systems where services
   depend upon each other.  I find this capability to be quite handy,
   and the syntax makes the process overall easier, if a bit less
   flexible.

   So can a compromise be reached by which it is decoupled or loosely
   coupled so that the dependency chain/startup order advantages can
   be maintained>

```

```

I just today learned about your initiative to fork Debian and I can't
agree more.

I haven't been using Debian for so long, as some other people who
already wrote you, only about 5 years, but it grew to my heart for
it's efficiency, pureness and power. No other distro I tried made me
feel so home.

Unfortunately, some late changes made be really uncomfortable. Every
day, I feel I have less and less control over my system up to point,
where I decided switching a distro. I tried, but none felt half as
effective as what I was used Debian to be.

Honestly, I was thinking about just the same thing. What if we just
fork the whole thing? Start anew. Draft rules, which reflect real
needs of real users. Start by packaging just the things, we need and
invite anyone to package what they need. But I wasn't sure, if the we
wasn't just I. I'm more than excited to know, that I don't feel that
way alone.

For me, using free software is about freedom. Freedom to choose my
tools at the most granular level. Don't have to swallow, what someone
else decided to be best for me. Even hack, modify or write my own
tools when necessary. Have control over my computer, not let computer
have control over me.

This abomination, systemd, broke about every essential freedom, we
used to have. I'm not saying to ban it. It's everyone's free choice
and those who want it should have the option. But there should be all
the other options for those, who don't. The arrogance of some people
connected to systemd is unprecedented.

With all of that said, I believe, there might be an easier solution
than a complete fork. Better support for OpenRC, Upstart, all the
alternatives, even old good SysVinit, if anyone wants to use that. But
I see less and less possibility for such movement. Reading some
threads and seeing the approach of many people makes me sad and disgusted.

I'd be happy to accept any solution. But if you decide to go to
Mordor, you've got my keyboard. Drop me a note and I'll see what I can do.

Yours sincerely

```


```

I agree with you, we should leave init as an option. Free should be
freedom of choice! About a fork, I've always used Debian I think it
has the capacity to reconsider, so I expect a fork is not necessarily.

```


```

A fork, IMO, would mean a completely parallel project to Debian, is this
really what is needed or even desirable?  If it comes to the point that
systemd is the *only* init allowed on a Debian system, then, yes, a fork
would certainly be a viable option.  In the mean time, keeping a systemd
free derivative distribution using existing Debian packages where
possible and rebuilding them when needed seems like a more sane approach
*at this time*.

I really have no love for sysvinit as I view some of the scripts in
/etc/init.d as a hoary mess.  I have no love and only contempt for the
beast systemd is becoming and seeks to become.  While I am currently
using it for netowrk manager support and Xfce Power Manager support, if
those packages could operate without the dependency on systemd, I would
be all the happier.  For too long I have been satisfied with the "just
works" of modern Debian until now.  I have lost my knowledge on how to
set up my system using basic acpid scripts and don't really know what
the acpid or the pm-utils packages do in the current context.  Also, I
like the new Xfce Power Manager, but I think it needs to work with power
management configured outside of the systemd tree.  Those are pressing
issues *for me*.

Consider your path carefully as I don't think a Debian project fork
would be necessary until at least Jessie+1.  Between now and then there
is time to weigh the options and build a solid Unix/POSIX derivative
that respects user freedom and choice.

I am keeping a close eye on all of these developments.

```

```

Debian admin since 1998, you have my support.

```

```

I'm not typically a Debian user, but appreciate what you're doing to
help avoid having systemd and its anti-Unix philosophy shoved down
everyone's collective throats.

```


```

Gentlemen and Gentleladies,

In the event your group chooses to fork Debian, what should we desktop
end-users expect to be kept or be the same from the Debian distro?

```

```

I don't have a whole lot more to add other than I am also a relatively
long time Linux/Unix sysadmin (nearly 14 years now) and whole
heartedly agree with the proposal to "preserve freedom of choice"
principle.

Unfortunately, like you I'm also burdened with not enough free
time/energy/desire to participate in the bureaucratic/political
environment that is Debian and much of the rest of the open source
world.  I simply want to do my job and play with computers in a way
that meets my needs.

Thanks for your efforts.

```

```

What's the intended target for the systemd-less debian fork? Server only,
or the full range of Desktop applications as well? Also, is there a mailing
list for the interested?

```

```

I've been working with and administering Unix systems since System III
(yes, that's not a typo :).  I have always appreciated the ethos of the
founding fathers of Unix:

    ...do one thing and do it well...

I use Linux for servers--no pointy clicky--just the command line.  Let's
keep init as it has always been, and leave systemd as an option for
those that actually want it.

```

```

My systemd Sid system suddenly booted with the root read-only.
I had to re-install the system.
Now I have Jessie, hope this is better.
I am afraid of systemd.

I will use the fork.

```


```

If you do fork Debian, please keep the dpkg/apt/aptitude tools but
change the package names away from the .deb file extension.  That file
extension should remain for Debian and since Ubuntu basically wrecked
that, the new fork should at least try to keep a file extension that
we know is deigned for this system.  The internals of the format can
remain the same, of course; it's just a name, but it should match the
system it installs on.

```

```

Hi there

I'm a long-time sysadmin, non-developer, and maintainer of some Debian
packages (IANADD).

I support you, and I would like to help as much as possible with the
fork- distro (SystemDebian would be a nice name :P just kidding) from
my expertise and little available time.

Hope it ends up being not necessary.

```

```

Thank you for this website and perspective.
I love debian but am not happy with some the recent changes.
I cut my Linux teeth on Debian.  I had my mom on it over 10 years ago
when we were using discarded x86 computers that could not handle NT
tech when it came out.
I maintain more than one professional Linux system, and was
disappointed and shocked to find that some apache defaults using only
core package modules were less stable than Ubuntu these days, but
maybe that’s not related.  I’m just not sure where they are going.
I was reading an old printout I had of the UNIX philosophy and it just
struck me how backwards systemd is to it.  Big, binary, monolithic
mess, a big departure from text readable I/O.  Some great code, but I
just could not get over the utter disregard its maintainers seem to
have just to get their code pushed into Linux bases.  I am grateful
Linus stood up against such shoddy programming grandstanding as I rely
on Linux so much.
I’m not sure what the way forward is, but the utter disregard for
compatibility and basically non-shalant directions to code around
their bugs that I seem to get from that teams’ posts leaves me
thanking greatly that Linus said something and tried to nip it in the
bud.
Still, he obviously is agnostic about the whole thing, and doesn’t say
systemd itself as a concept is bad, and I trust him.  Maybe it’s just
handled badly by the wrong people.  Thanks for your site and your
time!

```

```

Guys, thanks for this website, my feelings towards systemd was never
changed, I HATE it.  I've been administering Linux box for over 16
years. Never had an issue with sysvinit, and I never thought that, oh
let's build a new init system to boot the server faster. It just
worked!  So I'm thinking that Redhat is trying to dominate Linux by
betraying it's roots. And that's evil! So this is not an init system
issue. It is an infection, helped by a new breed of clueless
developers, raised by guys who likes change just for the sake of
change. And we must act! I'm not a debian developer (Just maintaining
a few opensuse packages), but I will gladly participate in a truly
free distribution. Free as in freedom and Free as in choice!

Btw, I have complained also to RedHat guys a few times as well (sales
people), not that I was thinking it would change anything, but they
should hear us too. So if anyone reading this happens to bump into
redhat sales guys etc. make your point!

And yes I have a beard :)

```

```

To be honest: A system should be kept as simple as possible. Having
systemd as an alternative for those who *need* it is ok. But putting
it as main init system is way overshooting.

```


```

Systemd does not sit well with me, and I don't want to be forced into
using it. Sign me up for anything that needs doing.

```

```

I'm a software engineer and sometime system admin, and I'd love to help
out.

Linux has always been full of choice, from window manager to editor and
even down to shell.  Freedom of choice makes Linux distros great, and
making software depend on the init system is simply bad design.

```

```

I am hearing a lot of talk in favour of Systemd and increasingly
voices warning against it. The trouble is I'm not sure I understand
the issue beyond the fact that Systemd doesn't stick to the unix
philosophy of managing tasks using small functional units.

If the issue is mainly philosophical then that is important but not a
reason to avoid Systemd in itself. On the other hand if you guys are
concerned to the extent that you're prepared to fork Debian then I
guess the implications must go beyond philosophy. Is there somewhere I
can go to see a comparison between what Systemd does and the current
init system so that I can understand the issues myself rather than be
swayed by one or other of the competing "camps"?

```

```

First of all, congratulations on your effort so far. I'm a bit sceptical
anyone could ever fork the Debian project without convincing about at
least half of the maintainers to join, it's just too big! (otherwise,
it'll be just one of the many derivates and maintaining it with VERY
crucial services like those provided by systemd -- after all it's NOT
just init -- replaced by something else will be close to mission
impossible) But at least, you have clear objectives and a vision. And
I'd like to support that somehow ...

Maybe I can add something morally: I'm NOT an administrator. At least
not professionally. I'm a professional software developer. I administer
some Debian systems privately (mostly for myself) and I'm also a
desktop-user of Debian. I recently upgraded my desktop box to Debian
jessie, and among other problems (my chosen GUI mail program, kontakt,
is now broken because of akonadi problems, this is why I'm writing this
using good ole mutt + vim), I was struggling with the huge "black box"
systemd is. My system is NOW booting fine that I allowed network-manager
(another black box) to "manage" my network devices. I don't want to know
why, I'm glad it works now. Just like I would with a windows box.

I have to say, I used to love Debian for its advanced manageability.
Even my private XEN dom-0 runs Debian, still using a kernel based on
Debian kernel-sources, but with integrated SuSE dom-0 patches
(integrated and debugged myself, quite some hard work), just because I
didn't want any other distribution (and back then, pvops wasn't quite
there, yet, but good old kernel 2.6.18 didn't support all the needed
hardware). So much for my Debian commitment.

So, even as a desktop- and hobby-user of Debian, I just don't get why
they need to jump on that systemd-bandwagon. I'm quite pragmatic on
this, as long as it works, I'll continue to use Debian. I'd just prefer
to really see through what's going on (and, e.g., why I need
network-manager now), that would be a much better feeling. Also, a
deterministic boot process has its benefits. I hate this "trial and
error" approach to solving problems like you're used to with windows
boxes. Maybe you can take this from my mail: It's not ONLY professional
system administrators who are opposed to systemd as the default init on
Debian jessie.

```

```

There was a time, during the beginnings of my Linux adventures when
any nasty complexity could be reduced to lucidity simply by reading
for a few minutes. I remember spending days compiling and crashing and
trying again and ending up with Gentoo. I remember stability in
9's. Throughout this entire evolution I have used Linux as my desktop
of choice and to this day I refuse to use anything else. A few years
ago I noticed the beginnings of the "adverse desktop mutation". When
dev's began chucking out stability for a more groovy desktop
experience, fashion over function so to speak.  Getting older and
having less time I came to a crossroads, build another Gentoo box and
get a divorce(not enough time) or move to Kubuntu - I'm still married
but I miss the days of bomb proof stability, speed and easily overcome
complexities. Enter systemd, seriously, wtf? Either I have burned more
brain cells than I realize or it is the FSM in a kaleidoscope. Oh
brilliant devs of OSS please spare us lowly sys admins from the epic
pain of systemd, if you continue to make us use it we will have to
relinquish our secret smiles as we will no longer be getting paid to
play. At the very least give us a choice, as we chose to participate
in this community specifically because of them.

```

```

I’m with you guys. I’ve often been asked why I prefer administrating
Unix and its derivatives vs Windows and I usually explain it this
way. Any idiot can install Windows Server but it takes a genius to
debug it if you have a problem. Unix requires a reasonable about of
technical knowhow to install but that same level of knowledge is
normally sufficient to solve problems. KISS over obscuration. We don’t
need Winux.

```

```

I've used Debian on my desktop and internet servers since the very
start of Debian.  What I liked is that Debian always took a strong
engineering-based approach to the OS, with package management done
right, continuous upgrades between versions, and lots of choice.
However, if they don't maintain a free choice of init systems, I will
drop Debian for some other distribution or OS.  Poettering's attitude
is appalling and contrary to everything I care about in an OS.
Somebody has to take a stand to avoid lock-in, and I sincerely hope
that Debian will do that since it has a history of caring about good
engineering and freedom of choice.

```


```

Where can funding for this be secured?

Already I have FreeBSD installed next to Debian - That really is how
desperate it is!!!

If there isn't a viable Linux alternative to systemd people WILL go
elsewhere...  (And compiling every package and update is NOT a viable
alternative!)

its pulseaudio all over again this time the stakes are higher, Debian
inertia is just too slow to save Linux from systemd

```


```

Fork Debian anyway, for We should not go quietly into the night.

There is nothing stopping us from throwing out an alpha/experimental
"fork" of Debian, but with NO systemd whatsoever.

 Sort of like a GNU/kFreeBSD, except, that in this case, it'll be a
GNU/kDebian.  ;) -anyway, but seriously.

 Do "they" really want to know how serious we all are?  Systemd is a
"controlling/creeping binary singularity" -so where the fsck is the
"freedom of choice" in that !!!???

To put it more technically: "...Do not go gentle into that good night,
... Rage, rage against the dying of the light..."  -Dylan Thomas.

```

```

I hope it never comes to this. And that whole of debian team stays
faithful to it's UNIX roots and gnu/linux philosophy.

Cheers and keep doing good work. Debian is the best OS ever.

```

```

action not threats! (sorry!)
but its getting to this...

systemd WILL wreck Linux - the "Linux after systemd" site is
unfortunately naive (oh how I wish it wasn't)

I can give a good 8hrs a week coding/building packages - debootstrap
level of skill...

It is obvious that the unwieldy meritocracy of Debian just can't
protect something as important as freedom (I know can you believe it!)

Please can you start to organise a group of people to discuss who has
what resources they can throw in the ring (time, bandwidth, even
money!)

Debian jessy will just about work with sysv only - at the moment - but
they have already knobbled auto-mounting so time really is short....

```

```

Trisquel uses upstart, and will until further notice.
It's also "FSF friendly"

```


```

UNIX exemplifies orthogonality of function and not the kitchen sink.
Systemd seems to be going the opposite way, when even dedicated
adherents of do-everything GUI's are beginning to realize their
errors.  IMO a move to it will signify a departure from the UNIX way.
At the very least, Debian users (and I've been one for 10+ years)
deserve the freedom of choice.

```

```

I'm absolutely agree with you, and I don't have a lot of words to say,
so how can I help you? I'm developer in IBM, I know shell and perl,
I'm ready to learn anything. Please, contact me if you need me.

```


```

Just want to say that I totally agree with what you are saying about
the systemd blob. I have been designing server systems for commercial
use with Linux since the late 90's. I saw the proverbial "writing on
the wall" many months back when I was trying to convince some Debian
developers that moving to systemd was a bad idea. Their tunnel vision
on the issue was amazing to me, I wondered then why was this
happening? How could these developers have taken such a wrong turn?
They were seriously proposing design methods and a software system
that had all the bad stuff that most Linux users had identified as
being wrong with the likes of Microsoft Windows in years past! It was
like they had forgotten all the lessons learned from Unix and software
engineering about how to create reliable and secure software. There
are SO MANY reasons that systemd is wrong that it is hard to know
where to start talking about it. Like I said previously, I saw the
writing on the wall and have already started migrating my designs to
freebsd.. however, if you guys do fork Debian I will be back
immediately and will give you any help that I can along the way.
Great web page!

```

```

Dear colleagues,

please let us know on the website, who you /really/ are.  I couldn't
find this information on any obvious place on http://debianfork.org/

While there are probably good reasons not to use systemd (but also
good reasons to use systemd), I don't see a good reason to set up a
website of this type while staying completely anonymous.  "Veteran
Unix Admins" is simply not enough to provide credibility (rather the
contrary).

I for my part will never ever follow any initiative where the
initiators stay in the anonymous dark and I'm sure others feel the
same.

```

```

My beard isn't long enough to warrant a strong reaction, but even I
can see the folly of a monolithic init system who's major backers are
corporate Red Hat. Fight the good fight.

```

```

Hello people: I am writing in support of your effort to retain
sysvinit as the default in debian instead of systemd. I am a
programmer and user of debian. I am watching and listening and will
lend a hand if there is a need, to fork debian. Thank you. (Ph.D.)

```

```

Hello I recently read your page about forking Debian. When reading it
I started to wonder what else will be changed if this does happen? I
realize the main reason of the fork is to switch out systemd for
sysvinit. But will any other changes occur beyond that?

```

```

I don't understand why you don't like to have another kernel in your
system, it's now even in userspace!

And it's written in the same very secure and easy maintainable
programming language called C as the original Linux kernel.

I suggest to invest into the future and to occupy PID 2 for your very
own kernel. Everyone should (and will want to) have one, so be fast in
order to still become an owner of one of the rare single digit PID
kernels.

```

```

AFAIC, (warning, childish name tweaks ahead) Redshat is the new
Microslop of the Linux world. Looks like I better start learning
Gentoo commands, Debian will be dumped or I'll use the fork.

You can quote me on your site if you like but I highly doubt you will,
lol. >:^D

```

```

I would like suggest the setup of a forum so that discussions would be
publicly available. It would also serve as a repository of discussions
regarding our main objective. Having discussions publicly available
helps spread the word better than internet chat.

```

```

Hi guys, is there some kind of irc channel where you guys hang out? Did administer 3k of debian boxes before, would be interested in your movement.

```

```

I have been a linux/Unix fanboy since highschool, and more recently a
professional sysadmin dealing with HP-UX, AIX and Solaris in addition
to various Linux distros.
The good old init never failed me, but Solaris' SMF and systemd most
definitely did, on many occasions.  I appreciate what you are doing
and I will be more than happy to help out any way I can, I would
actually love to see a lot of the other useless bloat, like FUSE,
gvfs, all the various kits and stuff like udisks get the boot.
Thank you for fighting the good fight.

```


```

Hello, I greatly admire your efforts and thank you for giving voice to
the countless Linux professionals and enthusiasts whose concerns are
being marginalised and whose warnings are not being heeded.  In
keeping with this, I'd be most grateful if you could provide a page on
your site (perhaps with suitable styling borrowed from some popular
news site) to host a piece of writing I've done which I hope will help
give the sceptics a fresh perspective on the issues.  See the text
embedded below. Best regards ----------------------------------

30 March, 2016

Licensing terms for core Linux technology revealed In a move which
sent shockwaves throughout the Linux community today, Red Hat
announced it was expanding its patent licensing regime to cover
systemd, a user-space management framework common to all major Linux
distributions.  A spokesperson for Red Hat's legal department stated
that "use of our intellectual property has always incurred fees, and
we merely seek to clarify how this relates to the systemd software
suite." The move follows Red Hat's acquisition last month of
Denizalti, an embedded software company whose TorpeDOS operating
system and related patent portfolio made them the subject of many
buy-out rumors in the past year.  Analysts had described the deal as a
synergistic opportunity for the two companies, justifying the decision
to sell by Denizalti's majority shareholder, In-Q-Tel. Reactions to
Red Hat's patent claims have been mixed.  A representative for SUSE
said in a statement that the company would seek a cross-licensing deal
with Red Hat, and that "SUSE's own defensive patent portfolio,
acquired under Novell and Attachmate, has been under-exploited until
now".  Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Canonical which owns Ubuntu, also
commented on the deal, saying in a blog post that "Ubuntu has always
been about making software free for non-commercial users, so Canonical
will be paying the license fee on behalf of those users who do not
have a commercial license from us." Among some smaller Linux
distributions, however, the reaction was more cautious.  A post on the
Arch Linux announcements mailing list explained that the major
developers were in talks with Red Hat to be adopted under the same
organizational structure as Fedora.  The Gentoo community, meanwhile,
were divided, with those using the default configuration -- which does
not include systemd -- being unaffected, but seemingly the majority
expressing concern that software might be no longer supported in the
distribution.  One such comment on a Gentoo forum read "What about
those of us who need systemd to support Gnome or KDE applications or
major packages such as Firefox and LibreOffice?  I even use systemd on
my Gentoo-based servers because half of the daemons I use don't have
init scripts any more and rely on systemd's cron, logging or security
features." Perhaps the most vocal community, however, was that of
Debian Linux, where Jared Hatcher, the project's elected leader, has
been coming under increasing fire for his handling of the situation.
In an open letter to the project, he attempted to justify his actions,
saying "This is an unprecedented time for the Debian project and I
have acted based on the best legal advice available.  Although I am
bound by an NDA to not share with you the details of the specific
patents that Red Hat are claiming and their interpretation of them, I
can only assure you that they apply not just to systemd itself, but
also the Essential systemd-based libraries that are part of every
Debian install, as well as systemd-shim.  Knowing that Debian mirror
operators would be faced with willful infringement charges if they
continued to distribute any installation images or systemd-derived
software, I took the only available course of action and ordered all
mirror operators and Debian infrastructure to cease and desist
operation." Although many Debian users and developers, faced with
running their desktops and servers without security support, have left
the distribution for safer alternatives, a dedicated core of Debian
developers remain, trying to keep the organization going.  One of
them, Ian Jackson, in an attempt to set a positive direction forward
for the distribution, has officially proposed a project-wide
referendum, known as a General Resolution.  The resolution calls for
"a complete re-bootstrap of all archives to be performed, from a
wheezy-lts base, without any code covered by the patents." to form the
basis of "oxeye", the next Debian stable release.  Despite receiving
more than sufficient support in terms of developers seconding the
proposal, it is by no means clear that this resolution will pass.
Either way, it seems like the result of the forthcoming vote will have
serious repercussions for this venerable distribution.

A few weeks ago I registered #debianfork on freenode irc.

I did this shortly after the GR was put forth to revisit the decision
about the default init system by Ian Jackson. I wanted to discuss it
on irc, but after being told in #debian that discussion on the subject
was not welcome there and that I should go to http://debianfork.org, I
decided that there was a need for a channel to discuss this.

Now, we have discussions there almost every day on the subject.

We would invite you to join us, or at the very least, please provide
the information that this channel exists as a place for people to
discuss their concerns in real time with real people who share the
same concerns on the website.

I look forward to talking to you on irc if you can make it!
